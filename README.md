This is War is a game constructed in Javascript based on the card game War.

The first challenge was to build a deck of cards, and assign worth to each card so that they could be compared later. Secondly, the deck had to be shuffled.

Once shuffled, the deck was split into two arrays, one for the player and one for the computer. During each turn, upon click, the cards are compared and the winner keeps the two cards. The logic behind this was challenging, because of the order in which the cards needed to be pushed back into the winner array.

CHALLENGES:

Due to limited time constraints, the actual war function is not completed yet, but there is a plan in play to make it work. As of now, if you do find yourself tied, you must turn to the p;erson next to them and have a real life fist fight with them, otherwise you lose.

Other challenges included styling, something I am not comfortable with yet, so what you are getting is the MVP at this point.
